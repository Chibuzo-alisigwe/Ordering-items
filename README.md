##Interactive Order Processing System

This Python program is most useful for creating interactive sites where users can order items and receive the total price of their orders.

Overview
The bills_1.ipynb script is a powerful tool designed for managing user orders by allowing users to select items and quantities, automatically calculating the total cost of their order. The program can be adapted for various use cases, such as e-commerce websites, online grocery stores, or any application where users need to interactively select and purchase items.

Features
User Input Handling: The script prompts the user to enter the desired quantity for each item available in the inventory.
Real-Time Price Calculation: The total cost of the user's order is calculated in real-time based on the selected items and their respective quantities.
Customizable Inventory: The inventory of items and their prices can be easily modified to fit different use cases, making the program flexible and adaptable.
Error Handling: The script includes basic error handling to ensure that user inputs are valid, preventing crashes and ensuring a smooth user experience.

How It Works
Inventory Setup: The program begins by defining a dictionary containing the available items and their respective prices.

User Interaction: The user is prompted to enter the quantity of each item they wish to purchase. The script collects this information and stores it in a separate dictionary.

Price Calculation: After the user has entered their desired quantities, the program calculates the total cost of the order by multiplying the quantity of each item by its price and summing the results.

Order Summary: The final total cost of the order is displayed to the user, along with a breakdown of the items purchased and their quantities.
